* permissions column
* to Google: - 'forgot my password'
* to Google: - 'reset my password'
* 'user authentication:' what does that mean?
Questions:
* how does Chrome know to remember their password?
* what's wrong with giving Maria the 'sign up as reg. admin link'?

* Step 1: Start with 1 level of admins. Make regular admin accounts. Rita gives over signup page, gives Hope/Maria their passwords
 - get route going to signup page but no links to that route on any other page
 - OR, Rita manually creates users. then worry about users updating passwords / other users resetting regular passwords
* Another first step: show a page only to logged in user
